The front-end of my first project- a restaurant website, built with html and css, no frameworks.
Home.HTMl- The sites homepage
galley.HTML- photo gallery of the site
contact-us.HTML- the contact page for the restaurant
Thats all im going to do with the site so far until i learn javascript, ill keep this updated as i go.
